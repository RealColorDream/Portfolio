## 🌟 What is LensJudge?

**LensJudge** is a tool designed to automatically evaluate submitted solutions during competitive programming contests.
It compares the output of a source file against predefined input data and their expected outcomes. LensJudge supports
evaluating both a single test case or an entire directory of multiple tests.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
$ lensjudge
lensjudge <sourceFile> <test.in> <test.ans>  # For a single test
lensjudge <sourceFile> <test-dir>            # For a directory of tests
```

## 📚 Example

```bash
$ lensjudge main.cc test.in test.ans
# Check if the output of main.cc is correct for test.in
```

```bash
$ lensjudge main.cc test-dir
# Check if the output of main.cc is correct for all tests in test-dir
```
